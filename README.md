### *Some Experiments* (aka, my first riso booklet!)

It's here! It exists! My first riso booklet! :star2:

I've decide to document my work here, because I was heavily inspired by different creative coding techniques to design this book. I saw this as an opportunity to experiment with new libraries, generative design ideas, and methods for printing with a risograph. I've thankfully learned so so much through this process!

Please feel free to explore the work behind each spread within this booklet. There's a lot going on, but I tried my best to cull together everything I used to create the final pages in a concise format. Also, you can see .jpg scans of each spread under [scanned_pages](https://github.com/erinachavez/riso_booklet/tree/master/scanned_pages)!

An enormous thank you to [p5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/), [p5.riso](https://antiboredom.github.io/p5.riso/), and the [SVA RisoLAB](https://risolab.sva.edu/) :sunflower:
